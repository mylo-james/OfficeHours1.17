# Office Hours App

## What should our App be?

  Let's make a zoo app that....

  1. Shows a list of all of the animals at /animals
  2. Shows a list of a certain type of animal at /animal/:animalType
  3. Allows us to add an animal at /animal/add

  This app should...

  1. Use Context
    1. Use a 'wrapper component for context'
    2. Use a custom hook to grab info form context
  2. Use Routes
  3. Have controlled inputs
  4. Validate form errors onChange not onSubmit
